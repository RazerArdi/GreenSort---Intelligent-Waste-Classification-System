    "Pengelolaan sampah di Indonesia menghadapi tantangan serius akibat rendahnya tingkat daur ulang (9% dari 68,5 juta ton sampah tahunan) dan inefisiensi rantai pasok, sebagaimana dilaporkan oleh Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan (KLHK) 2022 [1]. Kurangnya transparansi harga dan ketidakakuratan klasifikasi sampah menyebabkan rendahnya nilai ekonomi sampah, menghambat ekonomi sirkular. Proyek GreenSort mengembangkan model regresi untuk memprediksi harga sampah berdasarkan jenis, berat, jarak pengiriman, dan fluktuasi harga pasar, mendukung platform B2B yang meningkatkan efisiensi transaksi dan transparansi harga."

    "Berdasarkan hasil evaluasi, Improved Model dipilih sebagai solusi terbaik karena:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MAE yang lebih rendah (sekitar Rp5.000) dibandingkan Baseline Model (sekitar Rp8.000), menunjukkan peningkatan akurasi sekitar 37.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. R² Score yang lebih tinggi (0.95 vs 0.90), menunjukkan model mampu menjelaskan 95% variasi dalam harga, yang sangat baik untuk kasus regresi.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Grafik prediksi vs aktual menunjukkan hasil yang mendekati garis diagonal, mengindikasikan prediksi yang akurat di berbagai range harga.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Residual plot menunjukkan distribusi error yang relatif merata dan tidak bias, yang menunjukkan model robust dan tidak memiliki pola error sistematis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kesalahan rata-rata prediksi Improved Model hanya sekitar 2-3% dari harga rata-rata sampah (~Rp150.000), yang memenuhi target bisnis untuk transparansi harga yang akurat."
